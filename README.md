## Census Data Analysis for Rail Transportation Planning

### Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that will leverage census data and commuter rail transportation statistics to forecast commuter behavior.  This will allow for data-driven decisions to be made concerning transportation planning and the allocation of resources to better serve the public.  The main objectives will be to predict commuter trends by way of historic and current census data, develop insights that will optimize commuter experience, and make informed choices for resource allocation, infrastructure improvements, and any policy adjustments.

### Methodology & Data Sources

To obtain these objectives the project will employ a methodology that will gather a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic data from the US Census Bureau.  The data will be thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed to maintain integrity.  Key variables that influence commuter behavior, such as population density, income levels, employment data, and rail transportation factors, will be captured.  Using this data, machine learning and predictive modeling techniques can be applied to develop a robust predictive model.  This model will then be validated and interpreted so the outputs can be translated into insights.

* The data for the different machine learning models is provided and has been added to the repo as
* The data was acquired by way of the tidycensus package in R
